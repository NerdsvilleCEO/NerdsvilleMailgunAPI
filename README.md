# NerdsvilleMailgunAPI

This was developed to solve a very specific and simple issue and is by no means meant as a solution for connecting to the MailGun API when the specific environment that it was developed for is not being used.

  This is meant for you if 2 or more of these apply to you:
     -You are on a Linux Shared Hosting server with Godaddy
     -You have PHP <= v5.4 (as far as I have tested) and no means of upgrading
     -There is an outgoing block of port 25 SMTP, as well as 587.
  
  This is also meant for you if:
    -You are a developer looking to improve this API :)
    -You are a developer looking to integrate this in a site
